#add two strings together that, when concatenated,
#return your first and last name as your full name in one string.

#string concatination needs to space between to get a space printed
puts "hel" + "lo" #prints hello
puts "-------------------"

first_name = "Blake"
last_name = "H"
puts first_name + " " + last_name #prints Blake H

puts "-------------------"

#adding variables inside of strings
puts "Hello, your first name is #{first_name} and your last name starts with #{last_name}"
